In this course, we will study the emergence of the major civilizations
of the ancient world, beginning with the Paleolithic Era (about 2.5
million years ago) and finishing with the end of the Middle Ages in
fifteenth century A.D. We will pay special attention to how societies
evolved across this expanse of time—from fragmented and primitive
agricultural communities to more advanced and consolidated
civilizations. To do this, we will rely upon textbook readings to
provide historical overviews of particular civilizations and then
utilize primary-source documents to illuminate the unique features of
these individual societies. By the end of the course, you will possess a
thorough understanding of important overarching social, political,
religious, and economic themes in the ancient world, ranging from the
emergence of Confucian philosophy in Asia to the fall of imperial Rome.
You will also understand how many aspects of these ancient civilizations
continue to remain relevant in today’s world.
