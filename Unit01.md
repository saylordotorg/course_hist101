**Unit 1: Neolithic Revolution and the Birth of Civilization** <span
id="1"></span> 
*Civilizations are societies that rely on sedentary agriculture, develop
social stratification and economic specialization, and create
populations that are sufficient to support urban life. However, such
civilizations have only existed for the last 9,000 years *–* a tiny
fraction of the time that the human species has inhabited the earth.*  
  
 *In this unit, we will begin by defining what civilization means and by
understanding the early stages of civilization that emerged during the
Paleolithic Era 2.5 million years ago. Secondly, we will examine the
transition from hunter-gatherer groups to sedentary agricultural
communities during the Neolithic Age *–* one of the first great
transformations of human society.*
