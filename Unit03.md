**Unit 3: Early Civilizations in South and East Asia** <span
id="3"></span> 
*Like the ancient Middle East, civilizations in South and East Asia
first developed near great river systems.  The Harappan civilization of
the Indus River valley developed in the middle of the third millennium
B.C.E.—approximately at the same time as the river civilizations of the
Middle East.  But Harappa was unable to survive natural catastrophes and
nomadic incursions and disintegrated as a civilization between 1500 and
1200 B.C.E.  In East Asia, however, the Shang civilization served as the
foundation of a new and unified civilization—the Zhou dynasty—that
endured for millennia. *  
 *In this unit, we will examine the emergence and decline of these
important early civilizations in Asia.*
