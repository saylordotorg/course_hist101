**Unit 4: The Warring States Period and the Classical Age in China**
<span id="4"></span> 
*The breakdown of the Zhou Empire, in the third century B.C.E.,
permitted the establishment of many small kingdoms ruled by former
vassals and incursions of nomadic peoples who lived on the Chinese
border.  This period of internal warfare—called the “Warring States
Period”—stimulated intellectual ferment and the formulation of new
conceptions of political and social organization. The creation of the
brief Qin Empire in 221 B.C.E. seemed to promise a return to political
order.  Qin tyranny, however, produced resistance and the collapse of
the dynasty in 207 B.C.E.  The Han dynasty (which replaced the Qin
dynasty) ruled for nearly four centuries, and political unity was
achieved through the creation of a large civil bureaucracy.*  
  
 *In this unit, we will examine how political and social disorder later
resulted in consolidation and the emergence of a distinct Chinese
state—a far different polity than the fragmentation and chronic
instability that characterized the Zhou.*
