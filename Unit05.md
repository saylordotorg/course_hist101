**Unit 5: Classical Greece and the Hellenistic World** <span
id="5"></span> 
*Classical Greek civilization was one of the most influential
civilizations to emerge in the ancient world.  The Greeks’ conception of
government—particularly democracy—as well as philosophy, art, and
military strategy had a profound effect upon both ancient and modern
history.  This sophisticated society had its roots in the Greek Dark
Ages—also known as Archaic Greece—a period that was characterized by the
proliferation of tiny political units—known as “city-states” or
“poleis”—ruled by kings.  The classical period of Greece, however, was
dominated by two powerful city-states—Athens and Sparta.  In this unit,
we will focus on Athens and Sparta—their military conflicts, artistic
accomplishments, and cultural achievements—as well as the advent of the
Hellenistic Age.*
