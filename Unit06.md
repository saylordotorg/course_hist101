**Unit 6: The Roman Kingdom, Republic, and Empire** <span
id="6"></span> 
*Ancient Rome was characterized by three distinct periods—the Roman
Kingdom (from the eight to the sixth century B.C.E.), the Roman Republic
(from the sixth to the first century B.C.E.), and the Roman Empire (from
the first century B.C.E. to the fifth century A.D. for the Western Roman
Empire and to the fifteenth century in the Eastern Roman Empire).  How
Rome evolved from a monarchy to an oligarchic republic and then to an
autocratic empire will be the subject of this unit.  During these three
phases, innovative ideas about government, law, art, philosophy, and
architecture became prominent facets of Roman society—and remain
relevant in modern times.  However, many of these new ideas emerged
during periods of political instability and continuous warfare.  In this
unit, we will study the creation of republican Rome and the rise of the
Roman Empire, while also paying special attention to the violent and
volatile nature of this ancient polity.  We will also examine the major
features of Roman society and culture.*
