**Unit 7: The Classical Age in India** <span id="7"></span> 
*New kingdoms rose to power in Ganges River valley by 500 B.C.E.
 Urbanization emerged in the capitals of these kingdoms and near major
religious temples.  But by the sixth century B.C.E., religious thinkers
were beginning to challenge the rituals on which the Brahman elite—Vedic
priests—depended. The most important of these thinkers, the Buddha,
created a new religion that would have world-wide significance.
Moreover, the rivalry between Buddhism and Vedic religion, later known
as Hinduism, shaped the nature of Indian culture for many centuries.
 But out of this turmoil India entered a “Golden Age” under the rule of
the Gupta dynasty.  During this era, new and sophisticated ideas about
literature, art, and science became fixtures of Gupta society.  *  
 *In this unit, we will see that classical India during this period was
defined by political disunity and religious conflict broken only briefly
by unification under the Guptas.*

    audience of the play.  
        
     Note on the text: Most scholars regard Kalidasa as the foremost
    poet and dramatist in the Sanskrit language.  In this play, which
    translates roughly as “Of Sakuntala Recognized by a Token,” K?lid?sa
    tells the story of King Dushuntya, who meets and marries Sakuntala,
    the adopted daughter of a sage.  The tale reflects many of the ideas
    prevalent in Gupta culture.
