**Unit 8: Peoples of the Americas** <span id="8"></span> 
*Civilizations in the Americas emerged separately from other major
civilizations in the world.  The indigenous people of the Americas are
believed to have been immigrants from Asia, who crossed over to America
during the Ice Age, approximately 20,000 years ago.  These new
immigrants quickly spread throughout the Americas, in small and
culturally distinct groups.  The development of agriculture in the
Americas five thousand years ago led to the flourish of new culturally
advanced societies and innovations.  Pre-Columbian American
civilizations, such as the Mayas, Aztecs, Incas, and Olmecs were
socially stratified and technologically advanced.*  
  
 *In this unit, we will see that civilizations developed in two main
regions of the Americas: Mesoamerica and the Peruvian highlands.  In
fact, we will see that the entire area that stretched from central
Mexico to Chile formed a continuous chain of developing civilizations. *
