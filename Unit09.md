**Unit 9: The Rise of Islam** <span id="9"></span> 
*From its point of origin in Arabia, Islam developed into a global
civilization that eventually encompassed large portions of the Middle
East, Asia, Africa, and Europe.  Based upon the teachings of the prophet
Mohammad, the Islamic religion was based upon several universal
principles—a feature that attracted diverse ethnic groups to the faith.
 Although initially shunned by the nomadic Berber tribes in Arabia,
Islam was eventually accepted in the Middle East; it served as the core
of several Islamic empires, including the powerful Umayyads and
Abbasids.  However, despite the purported religious homogeneity of
Islam, the Umayyad and Abbasid dynasties were punctuated by religious
discord and political conflicts.*  
  
 *In this unit, we will examine the main tenets of Islam and consider
why so many diverse people adopted the faith.  We will also study the
rise and fall of the Umayyad and Abbasid empires and examine the reasons
behind the only major schism in Islam—the Sunni-Shi’a split.*
