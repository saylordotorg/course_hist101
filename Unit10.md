**Unit 10: African Civilizations** <span id="10"></span> 
*Four major areas of civilization emerged in early Africa: the
grasslands south of the Sahara, western Africa, the northern desert
regions, and eastern Africa.  Each area was unique, but the regions
became more interconnected as a result of two major developments: the
domestication of the camel and the arrival of Islam in Africa.  The
camel facilitated trade over long distances, including the vast Sahara
Desert, while Islam connected Africa more closely to cultures and trade
systems in the Mediterranean and the Middle East.*  
  
 *In this unit, we will examine the emergence of highly varied African
kingdoms.  Some, such as Mwenemutapa, developed in isolation from much
of the rest of Africa, while others, such as the Swahili kingdoms in
east Africa, were heavily influenced by the Arab world.  We will pay
close attention to commercial and agricultural advancements in Africa as
well as to the rise and impact of Islam. *
