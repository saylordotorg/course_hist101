**Unit 11: Eastern Europe: Byzantium and Orthodox Europe** <span
id="11"></span> 
*Two civilizations emerged in early medieval Europe: the Byzantine
Empire in eastern Europe and the diverse cultures of western Europe. The
Byzantine Empire was founded when the capital of the Roman Empire was
transferred to Constantinople in 324 C.E.; it existed until the
fifteenth century.  While Byzantium transmitted the classical culture of
Greek and Rome, it also developed a unique historical and cultural
character that synthesized Greek, Roman, European, and Islamic
elements.*  
  
 *In this unit, we will examine the expansion of the Byzantine Empire
and the fragile unity it created in the Mediterranean world.  We will
also consider the influences that Byzantium had among Slavic and
Scandinavian peoples, such as the impact of Orthodox Christianity.*
