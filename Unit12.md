**Unit 12: The Rise of Western Europe and the Spread of Civilization**
<span id="12"></span> 
*Before the medieval period, western Europe was one of the least
sophisticated civilizations in the world.  In fact, it was only by
inserting itself into foreign trade networks that western Europe
developed ties with the wider world.  In turn, these ties served as the
basis for the emergence of new ideas and technologies during the Middle
Ages.  Other than the development of new commercial connections, there
were two other major characteristics that defined the medieval period in
western Europe.  The first was Christianity and the Catholic Church (as
well as the official language of the Church, Latin).  The second was
feudalism.  The expansion of Catholic Christianity and the feudal system
had a profound impact on western Europe in the medieval era.*  
  
 *In this unit, we will study the Middle Ages as a period of widespread
political, social, and religious upheaval.  We will examine how western
Europe began to evolve from a region of disparate and migratory ethnic
groups to a more cohesive and sedentary people who shared the same
religion and language.*

     Note on the Text: Rather than being written in French or Latin,
    Chaucer’s late 14<sup>th</sup>-century text was the first to
    popularize the English vernacular as a literary form.  Many other
    medieval writers focused on the nobility, but Chaucer’s character
    sketches instead examine the lives of ordinary folk.  The “tales”
    also reflect the religious and social upheavals that characterized
    medieval England.
